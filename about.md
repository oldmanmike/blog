Hi, I'm Michael Carpenter and this is my little cache of html on the internet. I'm currently splitting my time between finishing a degree and system administration, but in my free time I write a lot of Haskell and work on [OpenSandbox](https://github.com/oldmanmike/opensandbox).

You can find me on [Github](https://github.com/oldmanmike) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jatosloth).
